Hello,

I would like to express my greatest interest in this position, as I believe I can effectively meet the company’s needs and exceed your expectations for this role.

I have been working with Flutter since its first days. I also have a solid background in native iOS and Android development, CI/CD, and I am even capable of writing some backend. I’m organized, familiar with software development processes, and extremely passionate about learning new things. Overall, I am not just a doer, I am an achiever. My priority is to create reliable and scalable solutions rather than just getting things done. All that made me believe that my experience might be of some help for the job described.

Please contact me via phone, LinkedIn, or email. Looking forward to our conversation!
